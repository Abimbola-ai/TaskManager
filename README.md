**Project: Task Manager**

**Description:**
Create a simple task management system where users can register, log in, and manage their tasks. Users should be able to perform the following actions:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - User registration.
   - User login and logout.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Add, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Mark tasks as completed.
   - View a list of tasks.

3. **User-Specific Data:**
   - Ensure that each user has their own set of tasks. Users should only be able to view, edit, and delete their tasks after logging in.

4. **UI/UX:**
   - Use Django templates to create a clean and user-friendly interface.
   - Implement Bootstrap or another CSS framework for styling.

5. **Database:**
   - Use Django's built-in database models to store task data.

6. **Forms:**
   - Implement Django forms for user input (e.g., adding a task).

7. **Middleware:**
   - Explore and understand Django's middleware, especially authentication middleware.

8. **Django Admin Panel:**
   - Allow administrators to manage user accounts and tasks through the Django admin panel.

**Learning Goals:**
- Understanding Django models, views, and templates.
- Implementing user authentication and authorization.
- Working with forms and handling user input.
- Utilizing Django's built-in admin panel for data management.
- Gaining experience in database interactions with Django ORM.
- Improving overall project structure and organization.

**Optional Enhancements:**
- Add due dates and priorities to tasks.
- Implement a search functionality for tasks.
- Allow users to categorize tasks.
- Use AJAX to enable asynchronous updates.
- Deploy the project to a hosting platform like Heroku.
